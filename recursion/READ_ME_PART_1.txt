Description: 
    This program uses recursion to calculate how many different combonations can be made to walk up a set of stairs. 
    The user provides the number of stairs and the program will output the number of possible combonations. There are
    three different type of steps that can be used to climb the stairs. A small step goes up 1 stair, a medium step goes
    up 2 stairs, and a large step goes up 3 stairs. For example a stair with 5 steps has 13 different combonations to 
    climb the stairs.

Instructions:
    Once the zip file has been unzipped make sure you are writing to the correct terminal. Go into the terminal and write make. Then
    type into the termal "./run_stairs". You will then be given the number of combonations for sets of stairs ranging from 1 stair to 20 stairs.

Limitations: 
    The program does not accept any input.
